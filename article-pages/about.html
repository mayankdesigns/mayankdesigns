            <p>Hi there, my name is Mayank and I'm a Pune based Product designer currently working with Scroll Media & ScrollStack. Previously I was creating experiences at - <a href="https://www.truworthwellness.com/">Truworth</a>, <a href="https://www.dotsquares.com/">Dotsquares</a>. </p>
            <p>I'm passionate about a lot of things, but specifically, Games, travel, photography, and doing good in the world. I like to feed cats and dogs on daily basis.I am currently feeding 20-30 dogs on a daily basis. The world can always use more love. </p>
            <p>I've designed and shipped multiple apps and gone through multiple release cycles on a larger project.</p>

            <p>I am currently focused on designing a open platform where readers can find energetic thinking, and where expert and uncharted voices can share their writing, podcasts, sketches, photos & videos on any topic & charge for their work. Some of the things I care or do in my daily life to make products better :</p>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>Making sure everyone feels like they belong on a product is in part the responsibility of the user experience design.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Set out to build a design language system (DLS) with some specific goals: create a common language that is understood across disciplines, establish an iconic visual language, and define components that make designing and building product easier.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Understanding the flexibility of the design with the tech team before going through any designing any product.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I'm a big fan of Slack and its integrations. It's really easy to share files and feedback. My team uses it pretty much constantly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I'm dedicated to building and integrating tools; everything from asset integration into Sketch to prototyping environments. Having access to everything quickly is crucial, whether it's an icon or a piece of research.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Say Hi</h3>
